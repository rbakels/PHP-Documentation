PHP Documentation in Man Page format
====================================
A collection of man pages for various PHP projects. Currently only has the PHP functions in man page format as a reference, but probably will expand in the future with more sources (such as the Symfony 1.x/2.x API).

### What is this about?
Well, nothing too fancy actually. It's the current PHP documentation in Man Page format. The PHP Documentation docbook sources are exported to a man page format, by using the phd command. The Man pages are provided as a convinience, so many users don't have to setup the phd program and execute it themselves. Thus, only 'binary' files are distributed. 

### How to use it?
  * Edit the pman.sh file and change the DOC_ROOT parameter to the path where you want to install the man pages. The default is: /usr/lib/php/doc/pman/
  * Copy the pman.sh file to your /usr/local/bin directory or similiar [The .sh extension can be omitted if you like]
  * Change the permissions of the pman.sh and set it as executable (e.g. chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pman.sh) 
  * Copy the manpages/* entirely to the DOC_ROOT path which you've set in the pman.sh file.
  * View with 'pman.sh <manpage>', e.g.
      pman.sh file_exists
